You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the \textbf{bookdown} package \citep{R-bookdown} in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and \textbf{knitr} \citep{xie2015}.

The course will cover the probabilistic framework for stochastic models
of real-world applications with emphasis on actuarial work. We will
illustrate some practical actuarial problems for which we will develop
mathematical models, tools and techniques for analysing and quantifying
the uncertainty of the problems.

Here are some of the examples which will be covered later in the course.

\hypertarget{examples-of-real-world-processes}{%
\chapter{Examples of real world processes}\label{examples-of-real-world-processes}}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-1}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-1}

\textbf{Example 1}. \emph{(\textbf{No claims discount systems (NCD)}) A well-known
model widely used by auto insurance companies is the \textbf{no claims
discount system}, in which an insured receives a discount for a claim
free year, while the insured is penalised by an additional premium when
one or more accidents occur.}

\emph{An example of the NCD system in UK may be structured as follows:}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cccccccc@{}}
\toprule
\emph{Level} & \emph{7} & \emph{6} & \emph{5} & \emph{4} & \emph{3} & \emph{2} & \emph{1} \\
\midrule
\endhead
\emph{Premium} & \emph{100\%} & \emph{75\%} & \emph{65\%} & \emph{55\%} & \emph{45\%} & \emph{40\%} & \emph{33\%} \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\emph{The rules for moving between these levels are as follows:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{For a claim-free year, a policyholder moves down 1 level.}
\item
  \emph{Levels 4\$-\$7:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{For every one claim, the policyholder moves up 1 level or
    remains at level 7.}
  \item
    \emph{For every two or more claims, move to, or remains at, level 7.}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Levels 2\$-\$3:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{For every one claim, move up 2 levels.}
  \item
    \emph{For every two claims, move up 4 levels.}
  \item
    \emph{For every three or more claims, move to level 7.}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Level 1:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{For every one claim, move to level 4.}
  \item
    \emph{For every two claims, move to level 6.}
  \item
    \emph{For every three or more claims, move to level 7.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{The no claims discount system is a form of experience rating consisting
of a finite number of levels (or classes), each with its own premium.
The 7 levels are experience-rated as described above.}

\emph{For the NCD model, questions of interest may include:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{For 10,000 policyholders at level 7, estimate the }expected
  numbers* at each discount level at a given time, or once stability
  has been achieved.*
\item
  \emph{What is the }probability* that a policyholder who is at a specific
  discount level (i.e.~one of the levels 1-6) has no discount after 2
  years?*
\item
  \emph{What is the }distribution* of being in one of the levels at time 5
  years?*
\item
  \emph{Suppose a large number of people having the same claim
  probabilities take out policies at the same time. What is the
  proportion would you expect to be in each discount level in the long
  run?}
\end{enumerate}

\emph{What would be a suitable model to study the NCD system? As opposed to a
\textbf{deterministic model} for which its outcomes are fixed, the outcomes
of the NCD model are uncertain. It turns out that the NCD system can be
studied within the framework of Markov chains, which are examples of
stochastic processes. The use of matrix algebra provides a powerful tool
to understand and analyse the processes.}

\emph{The evolution of the states or levels can be described the random
variables \(X_0, X_1,X_2, \ldots\) and probability distributions, where
\(X_n\) is the level of the policyholder at time \(n\). In this example, the
set of all states called the state space is discrete, which consists of
seven levels, and the time variable is also discrete. This is an example
of a \textbf{discrete time, discrete state space stochastic process}.}

\end{example}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-2}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-2}

\textbf{Example 2}. \emph{(\textbf{Poisson processes}) Consider the number of claims
that occur up to time \(t\) (denoted by \(N_t\)) from a portfolio of health
insurance policies (or other types of insurance products). Suppose that
the average rate of occurrence of claims per time unit (e.g.~day or week
) is given by \(\lambda\).}

\emph{Here are some questions of interest:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{On average, 20 claims arrive every day, what is the probability
  that more than 100 claims arrive within a week?}
\item
  \emph{What is the expected time until the next claim?}
\end{enumerate}

\emph{In this example, the state space consists of all whole numbers
\(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}\), while the time variable is continuous. The
process is a \textbf{continuous-time stochastic process with discrete state
space}. The model used to model the insurance claims is an example of
\textbf{Poisson processes}. The Poisson process is one of the most
widely-used counting processes. Even thought we know that claims occur
at a certain rate, but completely at random. Moreover, the timing
between claims seem to be completely random.}

\emph{Later, we will see that there are several ways to describe this
process. One can focus on the number of claims that occur up to time \(t\)
or the times between those claims when they occur. Many important
properties of Poisson processes will be discussed.}

\end{example}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-3}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-3}

\textbf{Example 3}. \emph{(\textbf{Markov processes}) Suppose that we observe a total
of \(n\) independent lives all aged between \(x\) and \(x + 1\). For life \(i\),
we define the following terms:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{\(x+ a_i\) is the age at which observation
  begins,\(\quad 0 \le a_i < 1\).}
\item
  \emph{\(x+ b_i\) is the age at which observation ends, if life does not
  die, \(\quad 0 \le b_i < 1\).}
\item
  \emph{\(x+ t_i\) is the age at which observation stops, by death or
  censoring.}
\item
  \emph{\(d_i = 1\), if life \(i\) dies, otherwise \(d_i = 0\), if life \(i\)
  censored.}
\end{itemize}

\emph{For example, consider the following mortality data on eight lives all
aged between \(70\) and \(71\).}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccccc@{}}
\toprule
\emph{Life} & \emph{\(a_i\)} & \emph{\(b_i\)} & \emph{\(d_i\)} & \emph{\(t_i\)} \\
\midrule
\endhead
\emph{1} & \emph{0} & \emph{1} & \emph{1} & \emph{0.25} \\
\emph{2} & \emph{0} & \emph{1} & \emph{1} & \emph{0.75} \\
\emph{3} & \emph{0} & \emph{1} & \emph{0} & \emph{1} \\
\emph{4} & \emph{0.1} & \emph{0.6} & \emph{1} & \emph{0.5} \\
\emph{5} & \emph{0.2} & \emph{0.7} & \emph{1} & \emph{0.6} \\
\emph{6} & \emph{0.2} & \emph{0.4} & \emph{0} & \emph{0.4} \\
\emph{7} & \emph{0.5} & \emph{1} & \emph{1} & \emph{0.75} \\
\emph{8} & \emph{0.5} & \emph{0.75} & \emph{0} & \emph{0.75} \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\emph{How would one use this dataset to estimate the probability that a life
aged 70 dies before age \(70 + t\) or survives to at least age \(70 + t\),
for \(t \in [0,1)\)?}

\emph{In this example, we can represent the process by \(\{X_t\}_{t \ge 0}\)
with two possible states (alive or dead). This model is also an example
of a \textbf{continuous-time stochastic process with discrete state space}.}

\emph{Here, we illustrate three actuarial applications which can be modelled
by some \textbf{stochastic processes}. We should also emphasis that the
outcome of one of the above processes is not fixed or uncertain. The
course will provide important tools and techniques to analyse the
problems with the goal of quantifying the uncertainty in the system.}

\section{Random variables}\label{random-variables}}

The dynamics of a stochastic process are describes by random variables
and probability distributions. This section provides a brief discussion
of the properties of random variables.

The probability theory is about random variables. Roughly speaking, a
random variable can be regarded as an uncertain, numerical quantity
(i.e.~the value in \(\mathbb{R}\)) whose possible values depend on the
outcomes of a certain random phenomenon. The random variable is usually
denoted by a capital letter \(X, Y, \ldots,\) etc..

More precisely, let \(S\) be a sample space. A \textbf{random variable} \(X\) is
a real-valued function defined on the sample space \(S\),
\[X : S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}.\] Hence, the random variable \(X\) is a
function that maps outcomes to real values.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-4}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-4}

\textbf{Example 4}. \emph{Two coins are tossed simultaneously and the outcomes are
\(HH, HT, TH\) and \(TT\). We can associate the outcomes of this experiment
with the set \(A = \{1,2,3,4 \}\), where \(X(HH) = 1, X(HT) = 2, X(TH) = 3\)
and \(X(TT) = 4\). Assume each of the outcomes has an equal probability of
1/4. Here, we can associate a function \(P\) (known as a probability
measure) defined on \(S = \{HH, HT, TH, TT \}\) by
\[P(HH) = 1/4,  P(HT) = 1/4,  P(TH) = 1/4,  P(TT) = 1/4.\]}

\end{example}

A probability measure \(P : \mathcal{A} \rightarrow [0,1]\), where
\(\mathcal{A}\) is a collection of subsets of \(S\), has the following
properties

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \(0 \le P(A), \quad A \subset S\).
\item
  \(P(S) = 1\).
\item
  If \(A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset\) for \(i,j = 1,2, \ldots\), and
  \(i \neq j\) where \(A_j \subset S\), then
  \[P(\cup^\infty_{i=1} A_i)  = \sum^\infty_{i=1} P(A_i).\]
\end{enumerate}

Random variables can be discrete or continuous. If the range of a random
variable is finite or countably infinite, then the random variable is a
\textbf{discrete random variable}. Otherwise, if its range is an uncountable
set, then it is a \textbf{continuous random variable}.

\hypertarget{probability-distribution}{%
\section{Probability distribution}\label{probability-distribution}}

The probability distribution of a random variable \(X\) is a function
describing all possible values of \(X\) and their corresponding
probabilities or the likelihood of obtaining those values of \(X\).
Functions that define the probability measure for a discrete or a
continuous random variable are the \textbf{probability mass function (pmf)}
and the \textbf{probability density function (pdf)}, respectively.

Suppose \(X\) is a discrete random variable. Then the function
\[f(x) = P(X = x)\] that is defined for each \(x\) in the range of \(X\) is
called the \textbf{probability mass function} (p.m.f) of a random variable
\(X\).

Suppose \(X\) is a continuous random variable with c.d.f \(F\) and there
exists a nonnegative, integrable function \(f\),
\(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0, \infty)\) such that
\[F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(y)\, dy\] Then the function \(f\) is called
the \textbf{probability density function} (p.d.f) of a random variable \(X\).

\section*{Examples of discrete and continuous random variables}\label{examples-of-discrete-and-continuous-random-variables}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Examples of discrete and continuous random variables}

The main quantities of interest in a portfolio of motor insurance are
the number of claims arriving in a fixed time period and the sizes of
those claims. Clearly, the number of claims can be describe by a
discrete random variable, whose range is finite or countably infinite.
On the other hand, the claim sizes can be describe by a continuous
random variable defined over continuous sample spaces.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-5}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-5}

\textbf{Example 5}. \emph{Let \(N\) denote the number of claims which arise up to a
given time. The range of all possible values \(N\) is
\(\mathbf{N} \cup \{0\}\). Here \(N\) is an example of discrete random
variable. We could model the number of claims by the Poisson family of
distributions. Recall that a random variable \(N\) has a Poisson
distribution with the parameter \(\lambda\) if its probability
distribution is given by
\[f(n) = e^{- \lambda} \frac{\lambda^n}{n !}, \quad \text{ for } n = 0,1,\ldots.\]}

\emph{Now suppose further that the number of claims \(N\) which arise on a
portfolio in a week has a \(\text{Poisson}(\lambda)\) where \(\lambda = 5\).
Calculate the following quantities:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{\(\Pr(N \ge 6)\).}
\item
  \emph{\(\mathrm{E}[N]\).}
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \(\Pr(N \ge 6) = 1 - \Pr(N \le 5) = 1 - \sum_{n=0}^5 f(n) = 0.3840393.\)
\item
  Clearly, \(\mathrm{E}[N] = \lambda = 5\).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-6}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-6}

\textbf{Example 6}. \emph{Let \(X\) denote the claim sizes in a given time period.
The range of all possible values \(X\) is the set of all non-negative
numbers. Here \(X\) is an example of a continuous random variable.
Suitable families of distributions which could be used to modelled claim
sizes are "fat tails" distribution. They allow for possibilities of
large claim sizes.}

\emph{Examples of fat-tailed distributions include}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{the Pareto distribution,}
\item

\section{Conditional probability}\label{conditional-probability}}

A stochastic process can be defined as a collection or sequence of
random variables. The concept of \textbf{conditional probability} plays an
important role to analyse dependency between random variables in the
process. Roughly speaking, conditional probability is the probability of
seeing some event knowing that some other event has actually occurred.

Let \(A\) and \(B\) be two events (elements of \(\mathcal{A}\)). The
conditional probability of event \(A\) given \(B\) denoted by \(P(A | B)\) is
defined as \[P(A|B) =  \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.\] Note that
\(P(A \cap B)\) is often called the joint probability of \(A\) and \(B\), and
\(P(A)\) and \(P(B)\) are often called the marginal probabilities of \(A\) and
\(B\), respectively.

The events \(A\) and \(B\) are independent if the occurrence of either one
of the events does not affect the probability of occurrence of the
other. More precisely, the events \(A\) and \(B\) are independent if
\[P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B),\] or equivalently, \[P(A|B) =  P(A).\]

\hypertarget{law-of-total-probability}{%
\section*{Law of total probability}\label{law-of-total-probability}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Law of total probability}

Suppose there are three events: \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). Events \(B\) and \(C\)
are distinct from each other while event \(A\) intersects with both
events. We do not know the probability of event \(A\). However, partial
information and dependencies between events can be used to calculate the
probability of event \(A\), i.e.~we know the probability of event A under
condition B and the probability of event A under condition C.

The total probability rule states that by using the two conditional
probabilities, we can find the probability of event A, which is
\[P(A) = P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap C).\] In general, suppose
\(B_1, B_2, \ldots B_n\) be a collection of events that partition the
sample space. Then for any event \(A\),
\[P(A) = \sum_{i = 1}^n   P(A \cap B_i )  = \sum_{i = 1}^n   P(A | B_i ) P(B_i) .\]

\hypertarget{conditional-distribution-and-conditional-expectation}{%
\section{Conditional distribution and conditional expectation}\label{conditional-distribution-and-conditional-expectation}}

Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be two discrete random variables with joint probability
mass function \[f(x,y) = P(X = x, Y = y).\] If \(X\) and \(Y\) are
continuous random variables, the joint probability density function
\(f (x, y)\) satisfies
\[P( X \le x, Y \le y) = \int_{-\infty}^x \int_{-\infty}^y f(u,v) \, du\, dv.\]

When no information is given about the value of \(Y\), the marginal
probability density function of \(X\), \(f_X(x)\) is used to calculate the
probabilities of events concerning \(X\). However, when the value of \(Y\)
is known, to find such probabilities, \(f_{X|Y} (x|y)\), the conditional
probability density function of \(X\) given that \(Y = y\) is used and is
defined as follows: \[f_{X|Y} (x|y)  = \frac{f(x,y)}{f_Y(y)}\] provided
that \(f_Y (y) > 0\). The conditional mass function of \(X\) is defined in a
similar manner. \[P(X = x | Y = y) = \frac{P(X = x, Y = y)}{P(X = x)}.\]

Note also that the conditional probability density function of \(X\) given
that \(Y = y\) is itself a probability density function, i.e.
\[\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{X|Y}(x|y)\, dx  =  1.\]

Note that the conditional probability distribution function of \(X\) given
that \(Y = y\), the conditional expectation of \(X\) given that \(Y = y\) can
be as follows:
\[F_{Y|X}(x|y) = P(X \le x | Y = y) = \int_ {-\infty}^x f_{X|Y}(t|y) \, dt\]
and
\[\mathrm{E}(X|Y = y) =  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x  f_{X|Y}(x|y) \, dx,\]
where \(f_Y(y) > 0\).

Note that if \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent, then \(f_{X|Y}\) coincides with
\(f_X\) because
\[f_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{f(x,y)}{f_Y(y)} =\frac{f_X(x)f_Y(y)}{f_Y(y)} = f_X(x).\]

\hypertarget{central-limit-theorem}{%
\section{Central Limit Theorem}\label{central-limit-theorem}}

This section introduces the Central Limit Theorem, which is an important
theorem in probability theory. It states that the mean of \(n\)
independent and identically distributed random variables has an
approximate normal distribution given a sufficiently large \(n\). This
applies to a collection of random variables from any distribution with a
finite mean and variance. In summary we can use the Central Limit
Theorem to extract probabilistic information about the sums of
independent and identical random variables.

\hypertarget{central-limit-theorem-1}{%

Let \(X_1, X_2, \ldots\) be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with a
finite mean \(\mathrm{E}[X_i] = \mu\) and finite variance
\(\mathrm{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2\). Let \(Z_n\) be the normalised average of
the first \(n\) random variables \[\begin{aligned}
        Z_n &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i/n  - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \\
               &= \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_n  - n\mu}{\sigma \sqrt{n}}.
    \end{aligned}\] Then \(Z_n\) converges in distribution to a standard
normal distribution.

\hypertarget{stochastic-processes}{%
\chapter{Stochastic processes}\label{stochastic-processes}}

Evolution of a random process is at least partially random, and each run
the process leads to potentially a different outcome. It is of great
interest to understand or model the behaviour of a random process by
describing how different states, represented by random variables \(X\)'s,
evolve in the system over time. Just as probability theory is considered
as the study of mathematical models of random phenomena, the theory of
stochastic processes plays an important role in the study of
time-dependent random phenomena. Stochastic processes can be used to
represent many different random phenomena from different fields such as
science, engineering, finance, and economics.

A \textbf{stochastic process} is a collection of random variables
\(\{ X_t : t \in T\}\) defined on a common sample space, where

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(t\) is a parameter running over some index set \(T\), called the
  \textbf{time domain}.
\item
  The common sample space of the random variables (the range of
  possible values for \(X_t\)) denoted by \(S\) is called the \textbf{state
  space} of the process.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The set of random variables may be dependent or need not be
  identically distributed.
\item
  Techniques used to study stochastic processes depend on whether the
  state space or the index set (the time domain) are discrete or
  continuous.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{classification-of-stochastic-processes}{%
\section{Classification of stochastic processes}\label{classification-of-stochastic-processes}}

Stochastic processes can be classified on the basis of the nature of
their state space and index set.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Discrete state space with discrete time changes} : No claims
  discount (NCD) policy: A car owner purchases a motor insurance
  policy for which the premium charged depends on the claim record.
  Let \(X_t\) denote the discount status of a policyholder with three
  levels of discount, i.e.~\(S = \{0,1,2\}\) corresponding to three
  discount levels of 0\%, 20\% and 40\% and the time set is
  \(T = \{0,1,2,\ldots\}\). Both time and state space are discrete.
\item
  \textbf{Discrete state space with continuous time changes} : In a health
  insurance system, an insurance company may classify policyholders as
  Healthy, Sick or Dead, i.e.~\(S = \{H, S, D\}\). The time domain can
  be taken as continuous, \(T = [0,\infty)\).
\item
  \textbf{Continuous state space with continuous time changes} : Let \(S_t\)
  be the total amount claimed by time \(t \in T\) where \(T = [0,\infty)\)
  and the state space is \(\mathbb{R}\). Both time and state space are
  continuous. Some continuous time stochastic process taking value in
  a continuous state space will be studied in Risk Analysis and
  Credibility course.
\item
  \textbf{Continuous state space with discrete time changes} : The outcomes
  of the above claim process \(S_t\) could be recorded continuously,
  however, we may choose to model the values only at discrete time,
  for e.g.~the total claim amounts at the end of each day. This may
  due to the limitation of the measurement process (for e.g.~expensive
  to measure). Hence, the time domain is discrete but the state space
  is continuous.
\end{enumerate}

In case that claim amounts are recorded to the nearest baht or in
satang, i.e.~discrete state space, we could also approximate or model
the process by using a discrete state space, rather than continuous.

\hypertarget{random-walk-an-introductory-example}{%
\section{Random walk: an introductory example}\label{random-walk-an-introductory-example}}

One of the simplest examples of a stochastic process is a simple random
walk. Consider a simple model of the price of a stock measured in
satang. For each trading day \(n = 0,1,2, \ldots\), the stock price
increases by 1 satang with probability \(p\) or decreases by 1 satang with
probability \(q = 1-p\). Let \(X_n\) denote the stock price at day \(n\) and
\(X_0 = 100\), i.e.~\(X_0 =\). This simple model is called a simple random
walk.

In the simple random walk process, time is discrete (as observed at the
end of each day) and the state space is discrete. The stochastic model
has an infinite number of outcomes known as \textbf{stochastic realisations or
sample paths}. A \textbf{sample path} is then just the sequence of a
particular set of experiments. Graphs of some stochastic realisations of
the simple random walk with \(p = 0.5\) and \(a = 100\) are shown in Figure
\protect\hyperlink{fig:SamplePaths}{1}.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:SamplePaths}{%
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4in,height=\textheight]{SamplePaths.pdf}
\caption{Some stochastic realisations of the simple random
walk}\label{fig:SamplePaths}
}
\end{figure}

A complete description of the simple random walk, observed as a
collection of \(n\) random variables at time points
\(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n\) can be specified by the joint distribution of
\(X_{t_1}, X_{t_2}, \ldots, X_{t_n}\), i.e.
\[F(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = \Pr(X_{t_1} \le x_1, X_{t_2} \le x_2, \ldots, X_{t_n} \le x_n).\]
However, the \textbf{multidimensional distribution function cannot be easily
written in a closed form} unless the random variables have a
multivariate normal distribution. In practice, it is more convenient to
deal with some stochastic processes via some simple \textbf{intermediary
processes} or under some addition assumptions.

In general, a simple random walk \(X_n\) is a discrete-time stochastic
process defined by

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(X_0 = a\) and
\item
  for \(n \ge1\),
  \[X_n = a + \sum_{i=1}^n  Z_i, \text{ where } Z_i = \begin{cases}
      1, & \text{ with probability } p  \\
      -1, & \text{ with probability } q =  1- p.
   \end{cases}\]
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  When \(p = 1/2\), the value of the process increases or decreases
  randomly by 1 unit with equal probability. In this case, the process
  is known as a \textbf{symmetric} random walk.
\item
  The (intermediary) process \(\{ Z_i : i \in \mathbb{N}\}\) is a
  sequence of independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random
  variables. The process \(X_t\) themselves are neither independent nor
  identically distributed. This process \(Z_i\) is also known as \textbf{white
  noise process}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-9}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-9}

\textbf{Example 9}. \emph{Explain why the simple random process \(X_n\) is neither
independent nor identically distributed.}

\end{example}

Suppose that \(X_0 = 100\). Firstly, we will show that \(X_n\) is not
independent. From definition, the process \(X_n\) can be written as
\[X_n = X_{n-1} + Z_n.\] That is, the value of \(X_n\) is the previous
value plus a random change of 1 or \(-1\). Therefore, the value of the
process depends on the previous value and they are not independent. For
e.g.,
\[\Pr(X_2 = 102) > 0 \quad \text{ but } \quad  \Pr(X_2 = 102 | X_1 = 99) = 0.\]

The process \(X_n\) cannot be identically distributed. For e.g.~\(X_1\) can
take the values of 99 and 101, while \(X_2\) can take three different
values of 98, 100 and 102.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-10}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-10}

\(Z_i\).}

\end{example}

\[\begin{aligned}
    \mu &= \mathrm{E}[Z_i] = 1\cdot p + (-1) \cdot q = p - q.\\\end{aligned}\]
\[\begin{aligned}
    \sigma^2 &= \mathrm{Var}[Z_i] \\
            &=\mathrm{E}[Z_i^2] - (\mathrm{E}[Z_i] )^2 \\
            &= 1 - (p-q)^2  = (p+q)^2 - (p-q)^2\\
            &= 4pq. \end{aligned}\]

\end{example}

\[\begin{aligned}
     \mathrm{E}[X_n] &=  \mathrm{E}[a + \sum_{i=1}^n Z_i] = a + n\mu.\end{aligned}\]
\[\begin{aligned}
    \mathrm{Var}[X_n]&= \mathrm{Var}[a + \sum_{i=1}^n Z_i]  = n \sigma^2.\end{aligned}\]
It should be noted that the variance of \(X_n\) increases with time.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-12}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-12}

\textbf{Example 12}. \emph{For the random process, calculate
\[\Pr(X_2 = 98, X_5 = 99 | X_0 = 100).\]}

\end{example}

The process \(X_n\) must decrease on the first two days, which happens
with probability \((1-p)^2\). Independently, it must then increases on
another two days and decrease on one day (not necessarily in that
order), giving three different possibilities. Each of these has
probability \(p^2(1-p)\). So
\[\Pr(X_2 = 98, X_5 = 99 | X_0 = 100) = (1-p)^2 \cdot 3 p^2(1-p) = 3p^2(1-p)^3.\]

In what follows, we will see that exact calculations are possible for
the simple random walk process. Note also that it is sufficient to
understand the behaviour of the random walk when it starts at \(X_0 = 0\).

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-13}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-13}

\textbf{Example 13}. \emph{For the random process with \(X_0 = 0\), \(X_{2n}\) is
always even and \(X_{2n+1}\) is always odd. Based on the binomial
distribution, show that \[\begin{aligned}
    \Pr(X_{2n} = 2m) &= {2n \choose n+m} p^{n+m} q^{n-m}, \quad   -n \le m \le n \\
    \Pr(X_{2n+1} = 2m+1) &= {2n + 1 \choose n+m+1} p^{n+m+1} q^{n-m}, \quad   -n-1 \le m \le n.\end{aligned}\]}

\end{example}

Let \(A\) denote the number of \(+1\) and \(B\) denote the number of \(-1\).
Then \(A + B = 2n\) and \(X_{2n} = A - B\) (i.e.~the position at time \(2n\)).
Hence, \[\begin{aligned}
    \Pr(X_{2n} = 2m) &= \Pr( A - B = 2m) \\
    &= \Pr( A - (2n - A) = 2m)  =   \Pr( 2A - 2n  = 2m) =   \Pr( A   = m + n)\\
    &= {2n \choose n+m} p^{n+m} q^{2n-(n+m)}, \quad   -n \le m \le n \\
    &= {2n \choose n+m} p^{n+m} q^{n-m}, \quad   -n \le m \le n.\end{aligned}\]

\hypertarget{discrete-time-markov-chains-1}{%
\chapter{Discrete-time Markov chains}\label{discrete-time-markov-chains-1}}

Recall the simple random walk model of the price of the stock. Suppose
the stock price for the first four days are
\[(X_0, X_1, X_2, X_3) = (100, 99, 98, 99).\] Based on this past
information, what can we say about the price at day 4, \(X_4\)? Although,
we completely know the whole past price history, the only information
relevant for predicting their future price is the price on the previous
day, i.e.~\(X_3\). This means that
\[\Pr(X_{4} = j | X_0 = 100, X_{1} = 99,  X_2 = 98 ,  X_3 = 99) = \Pr(X_{4} = j | X_3 = 99).\]
Given the current price \(X_3\), the price \(X_4\) at day 4 is independent
of the history prices \(X_0, X_1, X_2\). The sequence of stock prices
\(X_0, X_1, \ldots, X_n\) is an example of a \textbf{Markov chain}.

A Markov process is a special type of stochastic processes with the
property that the future evolution of the process depends only on its
current state and not on its past history. That is given the value of
\(X_t\), the values of \(X_s\) for \(s > t\) do not depend on the values of
\(X_u\) for \(u < t\). This property is called the \textbf{Markov property}.

A \textbf{discrete-time Markov chain} is a discrete-time stochastic process
that satisfies the Markov property:
\[\Pr(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i, X_{n-1} = i_{n-1}, \ldots, X_0 = i_{0}) = \Pr(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i),\]
for all time points \(n\) and all states \(i_0, i_1, \ldots, i_{n-1},i,j\).
It is convenient to assume that the state space of the Markov chain is a
subset of non-negative integers, i.e.~\(S \subseteq \{0, 1, \ldots \}\).

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-14}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-14}

\textbf{Example 1}. \emph{A process with independent increments has the Markov
property.}

\end{example}

Recall the following definitions. An increment of a process is the
amount by which its value changes over a period of time, for e.g.
\(X_{t +u} - X_t\) where \(u > 0\).

A process \(X_t\) is said to have independent increments if for all \(t\)
and every \(u > 0\), the increment \(X_{t +u} - X_t\) is independent of all
the past of the process \(\{X_s : 0 \le s \le t \}\)).

In order to show that a process with independent increments has the
Markov property, we proceed as follows: \[\begin{aligned}
\Pr(X_t \in A | X_{s_1} = x_1, X_{s_2} = x_2, \ldots, X_{s} = x)
&= \Pr(X_t - X_s + x \in A | X_{s_1} = x_1, X_{s_2} = x_2, \ldots, X_{s} = x) \\
&= \Pr(X_t - X_s + x \in A |  X_{s} = x)  \text{(by independence of the past)} \\
&= \Pr(X_t  \in A |  X_{s} = x).\end{aligned}\]

The random walk process has the Markov property.

\hypertarget{one-step-transition-probabilities}{%
\section{One-step transition probabilities}\label{one-step-transition-probabilities}}

The conditional probability that \(X_{n+1}\) is in state \(j\) given that
\(X_n\) is in state \(i\) is called \textbf{one-step transition probability} and
is denoted by \[\Pr(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i) = p_{ij}^{n,n+1}.\] Note that
the transition probabilities depend not only on the current and future
states, \textbf{but also on the time of transition \(n\)}.

If the transition probabilities \(p_{ij}^{n,n+1}\) in a Markov chain do
not depend on time \(n\), the Markov chain is said to be
\textbf{time-homogeneous or stationary or simply homogeneous}. Then
\[p_{ij}^{n,n+1} = \Pr(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i)  = \Pr(X_{1} = j | X_0 = i)  = p_{ij}.\]
Otherwise, it is said to be \textbf{nonstationary} or \textbf{nonhomogeneous}.

Unless stated otherwise, it shall be assumed that the Markov chain is
stationary. The matrix \(P\) whose elements are \(p_{ij}\) is called the
\textbf{transition probability matrix} of the process. \[P = \begin{bmatrix}
    p_{11} & p_{12} & p_{13} & \dots   \\

\end{bmatrix}.\] Note that the elements of the matrix \(P\) satisfies the
following properties:
\[\ 0 \le p_{ij} \le 1, \quad \text{ and } \quad \sum_{j \in S}p_{ij} = 1,\]
for all \(i,j \in S.\) A matrix that satisfies these properties is called
a \textbf{stochastic matrix}.

The transition diagram is shown below.

It turns out that the probabilistic description of the Markov chain is
completely determined by its transition probability matrix and its
initial probability distribution \(X_0\) at time 0.

\section{\texorpdfstring{The Chapman-Kolmogorov equations and \(n\)-step transition probabilities}{The Chapman-Kolmogorov equations and n-step transition probabilities}}\label{the-chapman-kolmogorov-equations-and-n-step-transition-probabilities}}

The \(n\)-step transition probability denoted by \(p^{(n)}_{ij}\) is the
probability that the process goes from state \(i\) to state \(j\) in \(n\)
transitions, i.e.~\[p^{(n)}_{ij} = \Pr(X_{m+n} = j | X_m = i ).\] Note
that for homogeneous process, the left hand side of the above equation
does not depend on \(m\). Suppose that the transition from state \(i\) at
time \(m\) to state \(j\) at time \(m+n\) (i.e.~in \(n\) steps), going via state
\(k\) in \(l\) steps. One needs to examine all possible paths (from \(i\) to
\(k\) and then \(k\) to \(j\)) and hence the \(n\)-step transition probability
\(p^{(n)}_{ij}\) can be expressed as the sum of the product of the
transition probabilities \(p^{(l)}_{ik} \, p^{(n-l)}_{kj}\).
\[\begin{aligned}
 \label{Chapman}
    p^{(n)}_{ij} = \sum_{k \in S}p^{(l)}_{ik} p^{(n-l)}_{kj}, \quad 0 < l < n  \end{aligned}\]
To derive \protect\hyperlink{Chapman}{\[Chapman\]}, we proceed as follows:

\[\begin{aligned}
    p^{(n)}_{ij} &= \Pr(X_n = j | X_0 = i) \\
    &= \sum_{k \in S} \Pr(X_n = j , X_l = k | X_0 = i)    \\
    &= \sum_{k \in S} \Pr(X_n = j | X_l = k , X_0 = i)  \cdot   \Pr(X_l = k |  X_0 = i) \\
    &= \sum_{k \in S} \Pr(X_n = j | X_l = k )  \cdot   \Pr(X_l = k |  X_0 = i) \\
    &= \sum_{k \in S}p^{(n-l)}_{kj} p^{(l)}_{ik} , = \sum_{k \in S}p^{(l)}_{ik} p^{(n-l)}_{kj}, \quad 0 < l < n . \end{aligned}\]

This result is known as the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. This relation
can be expressed in terms of matrix multiplication as
\[P^n  = P^l P^{n-l}.\] The \(n\)-\textbf{step transition probabilities}
\(p^{(n)}_{ij}\) are the \(ij\) elements of \(P^n\).

The transition diagram and the transition matrix of the simple random

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  In general, a state \(i\) is called \textbf{absorbing} if \(p_{ii} = 1\)
\item
  The simple random walk as given in Example

  can be modified so that whenever the process is in state 0 (or state
  \(N\)),

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    the probability of remaining in state 0 is \(\alpha\), and
  \item
    the probability of moving to state 1 is \(1 - \alpha\).
  \end{itemize}

  In this case, the state 0 is referred to as a \textbf{reflecting barrier}
  for the chain. The process might be used to model the fortune of an
  individual when negative fortune is reset to zero.

\section{An example of nonhomogeneous Markov chain}\label{an-example-of-nonhomogeneous-markov-chain}}

In this section, we give an example of a discrete-time nonhomogeneous
Markov chain. Again, without stated otherwise, we shall assume that the
discrete-time Markov chains are homogeneous.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-21}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-21}

\textbf{Example 13}. \emph{(Adapted from W.J.Stewart)
\protect\hypertarget{exampleStationary2}{}{\[exampleStationary2\]}
A Markov chain \(X_0, X_1, \ldots\) consists of two states \(\{1,2\}\). At
time step \(n\), the probability that the Markov chain remains in its
current state is given by \[p_{11}(n) = p_{22}(n) = 1/n,\] while the
probability that it changes state is given by
\[p_{12}(n) = p_{21}(n) = 1 - 1/n.\]}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Draw a transition diagram of the Markov chain.}
\item
  \emph{Write down the transition matrix.}
\item
  \emph{Calculate \(\Pr(X_5 = 2, X_4 = 2, X_3 = 1, X_2 =1 | X_1 = 1)\).}
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The transition diagram and the transition matrix are dependent of
  the time step \(n\), and are given as follows:

  \[P(n) = \begin{bmatrix}
      \frac{1}{n} & \frac{n-1}{n}   \\
      \frac{(n-1)}{n} & \frac{1}{n}   \\
      %\vdots & \vdots & \vdots  & \vdots \\
      %p_{d1} & p_{d2} & p_{d3} & \dots  & p_{dn}
  \end{bmatrix}.\]
\item
  The probability of taking a particular part can be calculated by
  \[\begin{aligned}
      \Pr(X_5 = 2, X_4 = 2, X_3 = 1, X_2 =1 | X_1 = 1)  &= p_{11}(1) \cdot p_{11}(2) \cdot p_{12}(3) \cdot p_{22}(4) \\
          &= 1 \cdot 1/2 \cdot 2/3 \cdot 1/4 = 1/12.\end{aligned}\]
  Other paths lead to state 2 after four transitions, and have
  different probabilities according to the route they follow. What is
  important is that, no matter which route is chosen, once the Markov
  chain arrives in state 2 after four steps, the future evolution is
  specified by \(P(5)\), and not any other \(P(i), i \le 4\).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{simulation}{%
\chapter{Simulation}\label{simulation}}

Simulation is a powerful tool for studying Markov chains. For many
Markov chains in real-world applications, state spaces are large and
matrix methods may not be practical.

A Markov chain can be simulated from an initial distribution and
transition matrix. To simulate a Markov sequence \(X_0,X_1, \ldots,\)
simulate each random variable sequentially conditional on the outcome of
the previous variable. That is, first simulate \(X_0\) according to the
initial distribution. If \(X_0 = i\), then simulate \(X_1\) from the \(i-th\)
row of the transition matrix. If \(X_1 = j\), then simulate \(X_2\) from the
\(j-th\) row of the transition matrix, and so on.

\hypertarget{monte-carlo-methods}{%
\section{Monte Carlo Methods}\label{monte-carlo-methods}}

Monte Carlo methods are simulation-based algorithms that rely on
generating a large set of samples from a statistical model to obtain the
behaviour of the model and estimate the quantities of interest. For a
large sample set of a random variable representing a quantity of
interest, the law of large numbers allows to approximate the expectation
by the average value from the samples.

Consider repeated independent trials of a random experiment. We will
need to generate a large number of samples \(X_1, X_2, \ldots\) from the
model. A Monte Carlo method for estimating the expectation
\(\mathrm{E}( X )\) is a numerical method based on the approximation
\[\mathrm{E}(X) \approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N X_i,\] where
\(X_1, X_2, \ldots\) are i.i.d. with the same distribution as \(X\).

While computing expectations and computing probabilities at first look
like different problems, the latter can be reduced to the former: if \(X\)
is a random variable, we have
\[\Pr(X \in A) = \mathrm{E}(\mathbbm{1}_A(X)).\]

Using this equality, we can estimate \(\Pr(X \in A)\) by
\[\Pr(X \in A) = \mathrm{E}(\mathbbm{1}_A(X)) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbbm{1}_A(X_i).\]

Recall that the indicator function of the set \(A\) is the defined as
\[\mathbbm{1}_A(x) =
\begin{cases*}
     1          & if $x \in A $ \\
      0        & otherwise.
\end{cases*}\]

The following user-defined function in Excel can be used to simulate
random numbers from a discrete distribution.

\hypertarget{classification-of-states}{%
\chapter{Classification of states}\label{classification-of-states}}

Throughout this section \(\{ X_n\}_{n \ge 0}\) is a time homogeneous
Markov chain with state space \(S\) and transition matrix
\(P = (p_{ij})_{i,j \in S}\).

For any \(i, j \in S\),

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The state \(j\) can be \textbf{reached} from the state \(i\), denoted by
  \(i \rightarrow j\) if there is a nonzero probability
  \(p^{(n)}_{ij} > 0\) for some \(n \ge 0\).
\item
  The states \(i\) and \(j\) are said to \textbf{communicate}, or to be \textbf{in
  the same class}, and denoted by \(i \leftrightarrow j\), if
  \(i \rightarrow j\) and \(j \rightarrow i\).
\end{itemize}

Note that \(i \rightarrow j\) if and only if there exist states
\(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_r\) such that
\[p_{ik_1} p_{k_1k_2} \ldots p_{k_r j}>0,\] i.e.~it is not necessary
that \(j\) can be reached from the state \(i\) in one single step.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The relation \(\leftrightarrow\) is an equivalence relation and
  partition the state space \(S\) into equivalence classes, which are
  known as \textbf{classes (or communication classes)} of the Markov chain.
  Thus in any class all the states communicate, but none of them
  communicates with any state outside the class.
\end{itemize}

Additional properties for a communication class are defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The class \(C\) is said to be \textbf{closed} if it is impossible to reach
  any state outside \(C\) from any state in \(C\), i.e.~escape from \(C\) is
  impossible. Otherwise, the class \(C\) is said to be \textbf{non-closed},
  i.e.~escape from \(C\) is possible.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If the entire state space \(S\) is only one communication class (all
  states communicate), then it is necessarily closed and the Markov
  chain is said to be \textbf{irreducible}. Otherwise, the Markov chain is
  said to be \textbf{reducible}.
\item
  A closed class consisting of a single state is an \textbf{absorbing
  state}.
\end{itemize}

It is a good practice to use transition diagram and also verify the
answers.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\item
  Every two states are intercommunicating, so \(\{0,1,2\}\) is a single
  closed class, and hence the Markov chain is irreducible. This is
  because \(0 \rightarrow 1\) and \(1 \rightarrow 0\) (\(p_{01} > 0\) and
  \(p_{10} > 0\)), and \(1 \rightarrow 2\) and \(2 \rightarrow 1\)
  (\(p_{12} > 0\) and \(p_{21} > 0\)).
\item
  There are two classes of intercommunicating states, \(O = \{H,S\}\) is
  non-closed, and \(C = \{ D \}\) is closed (and also an absorbing
  state). Clearly, the Markov chain is not irreducible. This is
  because

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(p_{DD} = 1\), i.e.~\(C\) is a class.
  \item
    \(O\) is open class because \(p_{HS} > 0\), \(p_{SH} >0\), so this is
    a class, and for example \(p_{HD}\) \textgreater{} 0 but \(p^{(n)}_{DH} = 0\)
    for all \(n\) (i.e.~one cannot leave \(C\) starting from the state
    \(D\)), so O is an open class.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The simple random walk with absorbing boundaries has three classes,
  \(\{1,2, \ldots, N-1 \}\) is non-closed class, \(\{0 \}\) and \(\{N \}\)
  are two closed classes.

\hypertarget{absorption-probabilities-and-expected-time-to-absorption}{%
\chapter{Absorption probabilities and expected time to absorption}\label{absorption-probabilities-and-expected-time-to-absorption}}

For the random walk with absorbing boundaries (i.e.~\(0\) and \(N\)), two
questions arises, in which state, \(0\) or \(N\) is the process eventually
absorbed (or trapped) and on the average how long does it take to reach
one of these absorbing states? We first define the following terms which
applies to the random walk process with absorbing boundaries.

The time of absorption \(T\) is defined as
\[T = \min\{ n \ge 0 | X_n = 0 \text{ or } X_n = N \}\] and the
\textbf{probability of eventually absorption} in state 0 is given by
\[u_i = \Pr\{ X_T = 0 | X_0 = i  \}, \text{ for } i = 1,2,\ldots,N-1.\]
The \textbf{mean time to absorption} of the process is given by
\[\mathrm{E}[T |  X_0 = i ] \, \text{ for } i = 1,2,\ldots,N-1.\]

\hypertarget{first-step-analysis}{%
\section{First step analysis}\label{first-step-analysis}}

First step analysis allows us to evaluate quantities of interest from
the Markov chain, for e.g.~the absorption probabilities and the mean
duration until absorption. The method is based on considering all
possibilities at the end of the first transition and then apply the law
of total probability to formulate equations involved all unknown
quantities. We illustrate how to use the first step analysis in the
following Markov chain.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:eg_absorption}{}\label{exm:eg_absorption}

\textbf{Example 18}. \emph{Consider the Markov chain with state space
\(S = \{0,1,2\}\) and transition probability matrix given by
\[P = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0    \\
    p_{10} & p_{11} & p_{12}   \\
   0 & 0 & 1   \\
    %p_{d1} & p_{d2} & p_{d3} & \dots  & p_{dn}
\end{bmatrix}.\]}

\end{example}

The classes and types are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Two closed classes are \(C_1 = \{0\}\) and \(C_2 = \{2\}\).
\item
  \(\{1\}\) is a non-closed class.
\end{itemize}

Let us consider the problem of evaluating the absorption probabilities.
For any closed class \(C\), define
\[u^C_{i} = \Pr(\text{Markov chain eventually absorbed in } C | X_0 = i).\]
Clearly, the absorption probabilities also depend on the initial states.
A vector of absorption probabilities is then given by
\(\mathbf{u}^C = (u^C_i)_{i \in S}\) We suppress the superscript \(C\) and
simply write \(u^C_{i} = u_i\) and \(\mathbf{u}^C = \mathbf{u}\).

Consider the closed class \(C_1 = \{0\}\). We have \[\begin{aligned}
    u_{0} &= \Pr(\text{Markov chain eventually absorbed in } C_1 | X_0 = 0) = 1, \\
    u_{2} &= \Pr(\text{Markov chain eventually absorbed in } C_1 | X_0 = 2) = 0, \\
    u_{1} &= \Pr(\text{Markov chain eventually absorbed in } C_1 | X_0 = 1) = u_1. \\   \end{aligned}\]
By considering the first transition from state \(1\) to either state 0, 1
and 2, and using the Markov property, the law of total probability gives
\[\begin{aligned}
    u_1 &= \Pr(\text{Markov chain eventually absorbed in } C_1 | X_0 = 1) \\
    &= \sum_{k = 0}^2 \Pr(\text{Markov chain eventually absorbed in } C_1 | X_0 = 1, X_1 = k)   \Pr(X_1 = k | X_0 = 1) \\
    &= \sum_{k = 0}^2 \Pr(\text{Markov chain eventually absorbed in } C_1 | X_1 = k)    \Pr(X_1 = k | X_0 = 1) \\
    &=  (p_{10}) \cdot  u_0 + (p_{11}) \cdot  u_1 + (p_{12}) \cdot  u_2  \\
    &= (p_{10})\cdot 1 + (p_{11}) \cdot  u_1 +  (p_{12}) \cdot 0. \end{aligned}\]
Solving for \(u_1\) gives
\[u_1 =  u^{C_1}_1 = \frac{p_{10}}{1 - p_{11}} = \frac{p_{10}}{p_{10} +  p_{12}}.\]

Similarly, we have \[\begin{aligned}
    u_0 &= p_{00} \cdot u_0 + p_{01} \cdot  u_1 +  p_{02} \cdot  u_2 \\
    u_1 &= p_{10} \cdot  u_0 + p_{11} \cdot  u_1 + p_{12} \cdot  u_2  \\
    u_2 &= p_{20} \cdot  u_0 + p_{21} \cdot  u_1 + p_{22} \cdot  u_2,  \\\end{aligned}\]
where the first and the last equations reduce to \(u_0 = u_0\) and
\(u_2 = u_2\), respectively. In general, for a closed class \(C\), the
vector of absorption probabilities \(\mathbf{u}\) satisfies the following
system of linear equations:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \(\mathbf{u} = P\mathbf{u}\) (here \(\mathbf{u}\) is treated as a column
  vector),
\item
  \(u_{i} = \Pr(\text{Markov chain eventually absorbed in } C) | X_0 = i) = 1\)
  for all \(i \in C\), and
\item
  \(u_{i} = \Pr(\text{Markov chain eventually absorbed in } C) | X_0 = i) = 0\)
  for all \(i\) in any other close classes.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:absorption}{}\label{exm:absorption}

\textbf{Example 19}. \emph{In this example, consider the closed class
\(C_2 = \{2\}\). Find the absorption probabilities \(u^{C_2}_0, u^{C_2}_1\)
and \(u^{C_2}_2\). Comment on these results.}

\end{example}

For the closed class \(C_2\), we proceed in the same way as in the closed
class \(C_1\). Let \(\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{u}^{C_{2}} = (u_0,u_1,u_2)^T\) be
the vector of absorption probabilities in the closed class \(C_{2}=\{2\}\)
with \(u_0 = 0\) and \(u_2 =1\). It follows that \[\begin{aligned}
    u_1 &=  p_{10} \cdot  u_0 + p_{11} \cdot  u_1 + p_{12} \cdot  u_2  \\
    &=  p_{11} \cdot  u_1 + p_{12}.\end{aligned}\] Hence,
\(u_1 = \frac{p_{12}}{1- p_{11}} =\frac{p_{12}}{p_{10}+ p_{12}}\). It
should be emphasised that
\[\mathbf{u}^{C_1} + \mathbf{u}^{C_2} = \mathbf{1} .\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  For any initial state \(i\), the sum of the absorption probabilities
  over all closed classes is 1 (as verified in Example
  \protect\hyperlink{absorption}{Example~19}). In particular, when a Markov chain has two
  closed classes \(C_1\) and \(C_2\),
  \(\mathbf{u}^{C_2} = \mathbf{1} - \mathbf{u}^{C_1}\).
\item
  In the case when \(S\) is finite or when the set of states in
  non-closed classes is finite, the vector \(\mathbf{u}\) is the unique
  solution of the above system of linear equations.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-24}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-24}

\textbf{Example 20}. \emph{Consider the Markov chain defined in Example
\protect\hyperlink{exampleMC}{Example~17}.
Find the absorption probabilities in the closed class \(C_1 = \{1\}\) and
\(C_2 = \{4,5\}\).}

\end{example}

Here \(C_{1}=\{1\}\) and \(C_{2}=\{4,5\}\) are closed classes and
\(0 = \{2,3\}\) is an open class.

Let \(\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{u}^{C_{1}}\) be the vector of absorption
probabilities in the closed class \(C_{1}=\{1\}\). Write
\(\mathbf{u}= (u_1,u_2, \ldots,u_5)^T\) and \(u_1 = 1\) and \(u_4 = u_5 =0\),
From \(\mathbf{u}=P \cdot \mathbf{u}\),

\[\left(\begin{array}{c}u_{1} \\ u_{2} \\ \vdots \\ u_{5}\end{array}\right)=P\left(\begin{array}{c}u_{1} \\ u_{2} \\ \vdots \\ u_{5}\end{array}\right) \text {gives}\]
\[\begin{aligned}
    u_2 &= \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} u_2 + \frac{1}{5} u_3 \\
    u_3 &= \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} u_2.   \end{aligned}\] Solving the
linear system for \(u_2\) and \(u_3\) yields \(u_2 = 4/11\) and \(u_3 = 5/11\).
Hence, the absorption probabilities in the closed class \(C_1\) is
\[\mathbf{u}= (1,4/11,5/11,0,0)^T.\] In addition, since there are two
closed classes,
\(\mathbf{u}^{C_2} = \mathbf{1} - \mathbf{u}^{C_1} = (0,7/11,6/11,1,1)^T.\)

\hypertarget{the-expected-time-to-absorption}{%
\section{The expected time to absorption}\label{the-expected-time-to-absorption}}

The expected time to absorption can be determined by analysing all
possibilities occurring in the first step. We again consider the process

matrix \[P = \begin{bmatrix}

    %p_{d1} & p_{d2} & p_{d3} & \dots  & p_{dn}
\end{bmatrix}.\] The time of absorption \(T\) is defined as
\[T = \min\{ n \ge 0 | X_n = 0 \text{ or } X_n = 2 \}\] and the mean
time to absorption of the process is given by
\(v = \mathrm{E}[T | X_0 = 1 ] .\)

The following observations can be made:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The absorption time \(T\) is always at least 1.
\item
  If either \(X_1 = 0\) or \(X_1 = 2\), then no further steps are
  required.
\item
  If \(X_1 = 1\), then the process is back at its starting point and on
  the average \(v\) additional steps are required for absorption.
\end{enumerate}

Weighting all these possibilities by their respective probabilities, we
obtain the following equation \[\begin{aligned}
v &= 1 + p_{10} \cdot 0 + p_{11} \cdot v  + p_{12} \cdot 0    \\
  &= 1 +  p_{11} \cdot v,\end{aligned}\] which results in
\[v = \frac{1}{1 - p_{11}}.\]

    p_{20} & p_{21} & p_{22} & p_{23}   \\

\end{bmatrix}.\] Let \(T\) be the time of absorption defined by
\[T = \min\{ n \ge 0 | X_n = 0 \text{ or } X_n = 3 \}\] and the
\textbf{absorption probabilities} given by
\[u_i = \Pr\{ X_T = 0 | X_0 = i  \}, \text{ for } i = 1,2\] and the mean
time to absorption of the process is given by
\[v_i  = \mathrm{E}[T |  X_0 = 1 ] , \text{ for } i = 1,2.\] Calculate
the absorption probabilities and the mean time to absorption.}

\end{example}

There are 2 closed classes including \(C_1= \{ 0 \}\), and \(C_2= \{ 3 \}\),
and one non-closed class \(O = \{1,2 \}\). Here,
\[u_i = u_i^{C_1} = \Pr\{ X_T = 0 | X_0 = i  \} = \Pr(\text{Markov chain eventually absorbed in } C_1 | X_0 = i), \text{ for } i = 1,2\]
By conditioning on the first step from state \(i\) and using the Markov
property, we have \[u_i^{C_1} = \sum_{j \in S} p_{ij} u_j^{C_1}.\]
Clearly, \(u_0^{C_1} = 1\) and \(u_3^{C_1} = 0\). In particular, we have
\[\begin{aligned}
    u_1 &= p_{10} \cdot 1 + p_{11} \cdot u_1 + p_{12} \cdot u_2 \\
    u_2 &= p_{20} \cdot 1 + p_{21} \cdot u_1 + p_{22} \cdot u_2, \\\end{aligned}\]
which can also be obtained from the matrix equation
\(\mathbf{u} = P\mathbf{u}\), where \(\mathbf{u} = (1, u_1, u_2, 0)^T\). The
solution to the system of linear equations is \[\begin{aligned}
    u_1 &= \frac{ p_{10} (p_{22} - 1) - p_{12} p_{20}  }{ p_{11}(-p_{22}) +  p_{11}  + p_{12} p_{21}  + p_{22} - 1}, \\
    u_2 &= \frac{(  p_{11} - 1) p_{20} - p_{10} p_{21}  }{    p_{11}(-p_{22})  + p_{11}  + p_{12} p_{21} + p_{22} -1  }  . \\\end{aligned}\]

Similarly, the mean time to absorption also depends on the starting
state. By the first step analysis, we have for
\(v_i = \mathrm{E}[T | X_0 = 1 ]\), \[\begin{aligned}
    v_1 &=  1 + p_{11} \cdot v_1 + p_{12} \cdot v_2 \\
    v_2 &=  1 + p_{21} \cdot v_1 + p_{22} \cdot v_2. \\\end{aligned}\]
Here the absorption time \(T\) is always at least 1. If either \(X_1 = 0\)
or \(X_1 = 3\), then no further steps are required. On the other hand, if
\(X_1 = 1\) or \(X_1 = 2\), then the process will require additional steps,
and on the average, these are \(v_1\) and \(v_2\). Weighting these two
possibilities, i.e.~whether \(X_1 = 1\) or \(X_1 = 2\), by their respective
probabilities and summing according to the law of total probability
result in the above system of equations.

Solving the equations for \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) give the mean time to
absorption \[\begin{aligned}
    v_1 &=  \frac{-p_{12}  + p_{22} -1}{p_{11}(-p_{22}) + p_{11} + p_{12}p_{21} + p_{22} - 1}, \\
    v_2 &=  \frac{p_{11}  - p_{21} -1}{p_{11}(-p_{22}) + p_{11} + p_{12}p_{21} + p_{22} - 1}. \\\end{aligned}\]

In this section, we present another important property concerning
limiting behaviour of \(P^n\) as \(n \rightarrow \infty\) and hence the
long-term distribution of a Markov chain satisfying some certain
conditions. In particular, some Markov chains will converge to an
equilibrium (limiting) distribution, which is independent of its initial
state.

We also assume that the Markov chain with \textbf{a single closed class} \(S\).

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Stationary distributions}

Throughout this section, we consider a Markov chain whose transition
probability matrix is \(P\) and state space \(S\) is a single close class.
Then \(S\) is necessarily closed and hence irreducible.

A probability distribution \(\boldsymbol{\pi} = (\pi)_{i \in S}\) on \(S\)
is \textbf{stationary} if the following conditions hold (here
\(\boldsymbol{\pi}\) is a row vector):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \(\pi_j = \sum_{i \in S} \pi_i p_{ij}\) or equivalently
  \(\boldsymbol{\pi} P =\boldsymbol{\pi}\),
\item
  \(\pi_j \ge 0\),
\item
  \(\sum_{j \in S} \pi_j = 1\).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  For any stationary distribution \(\boldsymbol{\pi}\), for all
  \(n \ge 1\), \[\boldsymbol{\pi}  P^n  =\boldsymbol{\pi}.\] Therefore,
  if we take \(\boldsymbol{\pi}\) as the initial probability
  distribution, i.e.~\(\Pr(X_0 = i) = \pi_i\), then then the
  distribution of \(X_n\) is also \(\boldsymbol{\pi}\) , i.e.
  \(\Pr(X_n = i) = \pi_i\)
\item
  The probability distribution \(\boldsymbol{\pi}\) is said to be an
  invariant probability distribution.
\item
  The most important property concerning the stationary
  distribution(which will be made formal) is that it gives the
  \textbf{long-term (limiting) distribution} of a Markov chain. In
  addition, \(\pi_j\) also gives \textbf{the long run mean fraction of time}
  that the process \(\{X_n\}\) is in state \(j\).

\subsection*{Proportion of Time in Each State}\label{proportion-of-time-in-each-state}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Proportion of Time in Each State}

The limiting distribution provides the long-term behaviour of the Markov
chain, i.e.~it is the long-term probability that a Markov chain hits
each state. In this section, it can be shown that it also gives the
long-term proportion of time that the chain visits each state. Let us
consider a Markov chain \(X_0, X_1, \ldots\) whose transition probability
matrix is \(P\) and its limiting distribution is \(\boldsymbol{\pi}\). Note
that the limiting distribution for the Markov chain satisfies
\[\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}  p^{(n)}_{ij} =  \pi_j.\]

For each state \(j\), define indicator random variable \[I_k =
    \begin{cases*}
      1, & if $X_k = j$ \\
      0,  & otherwise,
    \end{cases*}\] for \(k = 0,1,\ldots\). Hence, the number of times that
the Markov chain visits \(j\) in the first \(n\) steps is given by
\(\sum_{k =0}^{n-1} I_k\) and the expected long-term proportion of time
that the chain visits state \(j\) given that its initial state is \(i\) is
\[\begin{aligned}
    \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \mathrm{E}\left(\frac{1}{n}  \sum_{k =0}^{n-1} I_k \, |\, X_0 = i \right) &=
    \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}  \frac{1}{n}  \sum_{k =0}^{n-1} \mathrm{E}( I_k \, |\, X_0 = i ) \\
    &= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}  \frac{1}{n}  \sum_{k =0}^{n-1} \Pr(X_k = j | X_0 = i)\\
    &= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}  \frac{1}{n}  \sum_{k =0}^{n-1} p^{(k)}_{ij}\\
    &= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}  p^{(n)}_{ij} =  \pi_j.\end{aligned}\]

Here we use the fact that if the sequence of numbers converges to a
limit, i.e.~\(x_n \rightarrow x\) as \(n \rightarrow \infty\), then the
sequence of partial averages also converges to that limit, i.e.
\((x_1 + x_2 + \cdots x_n)/n \rightarrow x\) as \(n \rightarrow \infty\).
This result is known as Cesaro's lemma.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:weatherExample2}{}\label{exm:weatherExample2}

\textbf{Example 23}. \emph{Recall from
Example~\protect\hyperlink{weather}{Example~9},
the simple weather pattern can be classified into three types including
rainy (\(R\)), cloudy (\(C\)) and sunny (\(S\)). The weather is observed daily
and can be modelled by the Markov transition matrix
\[P = \begin{bmatrix}
    0.7 & 0.2 & 0.1    \\
    0.75 & 0.15 & 0.1   \\
   0.2 & 0.4 & 0.4   \\
    %p_{d1} & p_{d2} & p_{d3} & \dots  & p_{dn}
\end{bmatrix}.\] It can be shown that the stationary distribution and
also the limiting distribution of the Markov chain is
\[\boldsymbol{\pi} = (94/147, 32/147,    1/7)\] which gives the
proportions of visits to rainy, cloudy and sunny states are 94/147,
32/147, 1/7, respectively.}

\subsection*{The method of finding the stationary distribution}\label{the-method-of-finding-the-stationary-distribution}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The method of finding the stationary distribution}

To find the stationary distribution, we simply solve the linear
equations \(\boldsymbol{\pi} P =\boldsymbol{\pi}\) (note that one of the
equations can be discarded), together with the condition
\(\sum_{j \in S} \pi_j = 1\).

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-25}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-25}

\textbf{Example 24}. \emph{For the NCD process in Example
\protect\hyperlink{NCD}{Example~2}, the Markov
chain has the following transition probability matrix
\[P = \begin{bmatrix}
    1- p & p & 0    \\
    1-p & 0 & p   \\
    0 & 1-p & p    \\
\end{bmatrix}.\] Find the stationary probability distribution of this
chain.}

\end{example}

Denote the stationary probability distribution by
\(\boldsymbol{\pi} = (\pi_1, \pi_2, \pi_3)\). From
\(\boldsymbol{\pi} P =\boldsymbol{\pi}\) and
\(\pi_1 + \pi_2 + \pi_3 = 1\),
\[(\pi_1,  \pi_2, \pi_3)  \begin{bmatrix}
    1- p & p & 0    \\
    1-p & 0 & p   \\
    0 & 1-p & p    \\
\end{bmatrix} =  (\pi_1,  \pi_2, \pi_3),\] which is equivalent to
\[\begin{aligned}
(1- p)\pi_1 + (1- p)\pi_2 &= \pi_1 \\
p\pi_1 + (1- p)\pi_3 &= \pi_2 \\
p\pi_2 + p\pi_3 &= \pi_3 \end{aligned}\]

By discarding one of the equations and adding the condition that
\(\pi_1 + \pi_2 + \pi_3 = 1\), one can solve for
\(\pi_1, \pi_2, \pi_3\):
\[\pi_1 = \frac{(p-1)^2}{p^2 - p + 1},  \quad \pi_2 = \frac{-p^2 + p}{p^2 - p + 1},  \quad \pi_3 = \frac{p^2}{p^2 - p + 1}.\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In the above two examples, it can be shown that
  \[\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} p_{ij}^{(n)} = \pi_j > 0 , \text{ for }j \in S,\]
  or, in terms of the Markov chain \(\{X_n\}\),
  \[\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \Pr(X_n = j | X_0 = i) = \pi_j > 0, \text{ for }j \in S.\]
  This means that in the long run (as \(n\rightarrow \infty\)), the
  probability of finding Markov chain in state \(j\) is approximately
  \(\pi_j\) \textbf{no matter in which state the chain began at time 0}. This
  property holds for some Markov chains which satisfy \textbf{"certain
  conditions"}.

\section{Sufficient conditions for the long-run behaviour of a Markov chain}\label{sufficient-conditions-for-the-long-run-behaviour-of-a-markov-chain}}

In what follows, we will establish a set of sufficient conditions for
the long-run behaviour of a Markov chain. Two important results are
stated without proof.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:unlabeled-div-26}{}\label{thm:unlabeled-div-26}

\textbf{Theorem 1}. \emph{A Markov chain with a finite state space has at least
one stationary probability distribution.}

\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:unlabeled-div-27}{}\label{thm:unlabeled-div-27}

\textbf{Theorem 2}. \emph{An irreducible Markov chain with a finite state space
has a unique stationary probability distribution.}

\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:rwInfiniteS}{}\label{exm:rwInfiniteS}

\textbf{Example 25}. \emph{The simple random walks \(X_n\) on
\(S = \{\ldots, -2, -1, 0,1,2, \ldots \}\) is defined as
\[X_n = X_0 + \xi_1 + \xi_2 + \ldots + \xi_n,\] where the random
variables \(\xi_j\) are independent identically distributed with
\[\Pr(\xi = 1) = p, \quad \Pr(\xi = -1) = 1- p.\] We can check that this
Markov chain is irreducible. However, the state space \(S\) is infinite.
It can be checked directly from the equations
\(\boldsymbol{\pi} P =\boldsymbol{\pi}\) that there is \textbf{no} stationary
distribution (given as an exercise).}

\end{example}

First we know that the entries of a stationary distribution sum to one.
Suppose the contrary that there is a stationary distribution
\(\boldsymbol{\pi}\) for the simple random walk. Then by spatial
invariance of the simple random walk, \(\pi_i\) is constant for all
\(i \in S\) and also \(\sum_{i\in S}\pi_i = 1\), which is impossible because
\(S\) is infinite. Hence, there is \textbf{no} stationary distribution for the
simple random walk.

\hypertarget{limiting-distributions}{%
\section*{Limiting distributions}\label{limiting-distributions}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Limiting distributions}

One of the important properties of stationary distributions is that the
distribution of the Markov chain satisfying certain conditions converges
to the stationary distribution. This result provides the long-term
behaviour of the Markov chain. In order to state the main result of this
section, we need to introduce another concept, namely the period of a
state.

A state \(i\) is said to be \textbf{periodic} with period \(d > 1\) if a return
to \(i\) is possible only in a number of steps that is a multiple of \(d\).
Equivalently, the period \(d\) is the greatest common divisor of all
integers \(n\) for which \(p^{(n)}_{ii} > 0\). If the greatest common
divisor is 1, the state has period 1 and is said to be \textbf{aperiodic}.

A Markov chain in which each state has period 1 is called \textbf{aperiodic}.
Most Markov chains in applications are aperiodic.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-28}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-28}

\textbf{Example 26}. \emph{Is the NCD system in
Example~\protect\hyperlink{NCD}{Example~2}
aperiodic?}

\end{example}

The entire state space of the NCD system is a single class, and is
necessarily closed. Note also that \(p_{00} > 0\) (and also \(p_{22} > 0\)),
i.e.~the state 0 (and state 2) has an arrow back to itself.
Consequently, it is aperiodic because a return to this state is possible
in any number of steps (or the system can remain in this state in any
length of time).

Similarly, a return to state 1 is possible in \(2,3, \ldots\) steps.
Therefore, the NCD system is aperiodic.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Periodicity is a class property, i.e.~all states in one class have
  the same period (or if \(i \leftrightarrow j\), then \(i\) and \(j\) have
  the same period).
\item
  The Markov chain \(\{X_n\}_{n\ge 0}\) is aperiodic if and only if
  there exists some \(n >0\) such that
  \[p^{(n)}_{ij} > 0 \text{ for all } i,j \in S.\] Such Markov chain
  is also called \textbf{regular}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-29}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-29}

\textbf{Example 27}. \emph{In the random walk model on a finite state space
\(S = \{0,1,\ldots, N\}\) with absorbing boundaries in
Example~\protect\hyperlink{simpleRW}{Example~12}, determine the period of each state.}

\end{example}

The transition diagram and the transition matrix of the simple random
walk with absorbing boundaries (states) are given as follows:

The simple random walk with absorbing boundaries has three classes,
\(O = \{1, 2, \ldots, N - 1\}\) is non-closed class, \(C_1 = {0}\) and
\(C_2 = {N}\) are two closed classes. For each state \(i\) in \(O\),
\(p^{(2n)}_{ii} > 0\) and \(p^{(2n+1)}_{ii} = 0\) for \(n = 1,2,\ldots\).
Therefore, the state \(i\) in this open communication class has period 2.

On the other hand, \(p_{00} = 1\) (and also \(p_{NN} = 1\)) and hence, the
states \(0\) and \(N\) are aperiodic because a return to each of these
states is possible in any number of steps (or the system can remain in
this state in any length of time).

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-30}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-30}

\textbf{Example 28}. \emph{In the random walk model on an infinite state space
\(S = \{\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2, \ldots \}\) in
Example~\protect\hyperlink{rwInfiniteS}{Example~25}, determine the period of each state.}

\end{example}

The entire state space is a single class. Note also that
\(p^{(2n)}_{ii} > 0\) and \(p^{(2n+1)}_{ii} = 0\) for \(n = 1,2,\ldots\).
Therefore each state in the random walk on an infinite set \(S\) is
periodic with period 2.

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-31}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-31}

\textbf{Example 29}. \emph{Suppose the states of the system are \(\{1,2,3,4 \}\) and
the transition matrix is \[P = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1/2 & 0 & 1/2    \\
    1/4 & 0 & 3/4 & 0   \\
    0 & 1/3 & 0 & 2/3    \\
    1/2 & 0 & 1/2 & 0   \\
\end{bmatrix}.\] Determine the period of each state.}

\end{example}

The entire state space is a single class. Note also that
\(p^{(2n)}_{ii} > 0\) and \(p^{(2n+1)}_{ii} = 0\) for \(n = 1,2,\ldots\).
Therefore each state in the random walk on an infinite set \(S\) is
periodic with period 2.

\end{example}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  To find the stationary distribution
  \(\boldsymbol{\pi} = (\pi_{1}, \pi_{2})\), we need to solve
  \[\left(\pi_{1},  \pi_{2}\right) \begin{bmatrix}

  \[\pi_{1} +  \pi_{2}  = 1.\] This gives
  \(\boldsymbol{\pi} = (1/2, 1/2).\)
\item
  There is an equal chance of being in either state. Note that for any
  initial probability distribution
  \(\boldsymbol{\mu} = (\mu_{1},\mu_{2})\) with \(\mu_{1}+\mu_{2}=1\), we
  have

  \[\boldsymbol{\mu} \cdot P=\boldsymbol{\mu} \cdot P^{3}=\boldsymbol{\mu} \cdot P^{5}=\ldots
  =(\mu_{2},\mu_{1})\] and
  \[\boldsymbol{\mu} P^{2}=\boldsymbol{\mu} P^{4}=\boldsymbol{\mu} P^{6}=\ldots = (\mu_{1},\mu_{2}).\]

  The process does not settle down to an equilibrium position. Note
  also that the chain is not aperiodic, i.e.~each state is periodic of
  period 2. The process does not conform to stationary in the long
  run.

\protect\hyperlink{exampleLongTerm}{Example~30}}

\end{example}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The process is finite and irreducible, so a unique stationary
  distribution exists. To find the stationary distribution
  \(\boldsymbol{\pi} = (\pi_{1}, \pi_{2})\), we need to solve
  \[\left(\pi_{1},  \pi_{2}\right) \begin{bmatrix}
      1/3 & 2/3   \\
      2/3 & 1/3   \\
      %\vdots & \vdots & \vdots  & \vdots \\
      %p_{d1} & p_{d2} & p_{d3} & \dots  & p_{dn}
  \end{bmatrix} = \left(\pi_{1},  \pi_{2}\right),\] and
  \[\pi_{1} +  \pi_{2}  = 1.\] Solving the system of linear equations
  gives \(\boldsymbol{\pi} = (1/2, 1/2).\)
\item
  The chain is aperiodic. Therefore, according to the results from
  Example~\protect\hyperlink{exampleStationary}{Example~22}, if follows that
  \[\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} p_{i1}^{(n)} = 1/2 > 0 , \text{ and }  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} p_{i2}^{(n)} = 1/2,\]
  which is independent of \(i\). This is contrast to the process given
  in Example~\protect\hyperlink{exampleLongTerm}{Example~30}, i.e.~the process in this example
  reaches the stationary probability distribution in the long run.

The main result in this section can be stated as follows:

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:unlabeled-div-33}{}\label{thm:unlabeled-div-33}

\textbf{Theorem 3}. \emph{Let \(P\) be the transition probability matrix of a
homogeneous discrete-time Markov chain \(\{X_n \}_{n \ge 0}\). If the
Markov chain is}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{finite,}
\item
  \emph{irreducible and}
\item
  \emph{aperiodic,}
\end{itemize}

\emph{then there is the unique probability distribution
\(\boldsymbol{\pi} = (\pi_j)_{j\in S}\) such that
\[\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} p^{(n)}_{ij} = \pi_j > 0, \text{ for any } j \in S\]
and \[\sum_{j \in S} \pi_j = 1,\] and this distribution is independent
of the initial state. Such probability distribution \(\boldsymbol{\pi}\)
is called the \textbf{limiting probability distribution}. In addition, the
limiting distribution \(\boldsymbol{\pi} = (\pi_j)_{j\in S}\) is the
stationary probability distribution of the Markov chain, i.e.~it also
satisfies \(\boldsymbol{\pi} P =\boldsymbol{\pi}\).}

\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-34}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-34}

\textbf{Example 32}. \emph{Recall the Markov chain as given in
Example~\protect\hyperlink{exampleStationary}{Example~22}. The Markov chain is finite, irreducible
and aperiodic. We have also shown that
\[\boldsymbol{\pi} = \left( \frac{b}{a+b},  \frac{a}{a+b} \right)\] is
the limiting distribution, i.e.
\[\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} p_{ij}^{(n)} = \pi_j > 0 , \text{ for }j \in \{1,2\},\]
independent of \(i\). This limiting distribution is also the unique
stationary distribution of the Markov chain, which can be verified by
\[\left( \frac{b}{a+b},  \frac{a}{a+b} \right) \begin{bmatrix}
    1-a & a   \\
    b & 1-b   \\
\end{bmatrix} =  \left( \frac{b}{a+b},  \frac{a}{a+b} \right),\] where
\(0 < a,b < 1.\)}

\end{example}

\begin{example}
\protect\hypertarget{exm:unlabeled-div-35}{}\label{exm:unlabeled-div-35}

\textbf{Example 33}. \emph{The above result can be applied to the NCD system
because it is finite, irreducible and aperiodic. Indeed, there is the
unique limiting probability distribution
\[\boldsymbol{\pi} = \left(\frac{(p-1)^2}{p^2 - p +1}, \frac{p - p^2}{p^2 - p +1}, \frac{p^2}{p^2 - p +1}\right),\]
which is the stationary distribution of the chain. This gives the
long-term behaviour of the Markov chain, i.e.~the probability of finding
the Markov chain in state \(j\) is approximately \(\pi_j\) independent of
the initial distribution.}

\emph{For example, let \(p = 0.8\) in the transition probability matrix \(P\).
We compute several powers of \(P\) as follows: \[\begin{aligned}
P &= \begin{bmatrix}
0.2 & 0.8 & 0\\
0.2 & 0 & 0.8\\
0 & 0.2 & 0.8\\
\end{bmatrix}

P^2 &= \begin{bmatrix}
0.2 & 0.16 & 0.64\\
0.04 & 0.32 & 0.64\\
0.04 & 0.16 & 0.8\\
\end{bmatrix}, \\
P^4 &= \begin{bmatrix}
0.072 & 0.1856 & 0.7424\\
0.0464 & 0.2112 & 0.7424\\
0.0464 & 0.1856 & 0.768\\
\end{bmatrix}
,  &
P^8 &= \begin{bmatrix}
0.0482432 & 0.1903514 & 0.7614054\\
0.04758784 & 0.1910067 & 0.7614054\\
0.04758784 & 0.1903514 & 0.7620608\\
\end{bmatrix} \\
P^{16} &= \begin{bmatrix}
0.04761946 & 0.1904761 & 0.7619044\\
0.04761903 & 0.1904765 & 0.7619044\\
0.04761903 & 0.1904761 & 0.7619049\\
\end{bmatrix}
,  &
P^{32} &= \begin{bmatrix}
0.04761905 & 0.1904762 & 0.7619048\\
0.04761905 & 0.1904762 & 0.7619048\\
0.04761905 & 0.1904762 & 0.7619048\\
\end{bmatrix}.\end{aligned}\]}

\end{example}

The limiting probability distribution is
\[\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} P^n=
 \begin{bmatrix}
0.04761905 & 0.1904762 & 0.7619048\\
0.04761905 & 0.1904762 & 0.7619048\\
0.04761905 & 0.1904762 & 0.7619048\\

\(p\) is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated

\[
SE = \sqrt(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
\]

You can also use math in footnotes like this\footnote{where we mention \(p = \frac{a}{b}\)}.

We will approximate standard error to 0.027\footnote{\(p\) is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated
